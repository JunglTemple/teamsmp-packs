# Team SMP Resource Packs
This repo contains all of the Team SMP's resource packs.

## SHA-1 Verification
Server resource packs also require SHA-1 checksums in order to verify the integrity of the file while downloading to the client. The checksums for the packs are:
* Version 1.0.0: `5c87c49afa8d64e8b157db2102246a6cfcf700f4`
* Version 1.1.0: `8da3bec09716a54dcc2dcddede35ee77163ffe90`
* Version 1.1.1: `68098a1d6576157d106d3863cb02caf9b76aab85`

This list will expand after more versions are added.

## General Info
The resource packs that have been merged are:
* [Nautical Ranks](https://github.com/DeathEnderMan/Nautical-Ranks) on GitHub — for BetterRanks-style rank textures (slightly modified)
* [Bare Bones](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/bare-bones) on Modrinth — for a trailer-like look
* The Team SMP proprietary custom resources

The list will, once again, grow as more packs are added.

## Hosting
The packs are hosted through [MCPacks](https://mc-packs.net/) which is a website that simply hosts server resource packs for you. Here are the links for each of the versions:
* [Version 1.1.0](https://mc-packs.net/download/8da3bec09716a54dcc2dcddede35ee77163ffe90)
* [Version 1.1.1](https://mc-packs.net/download/68098a1d6576157d106d3863cb02caf9b76aab85)

## Usage
If you decide to use these resource packs on **your** server, remember to credit the Team SMP team as you are basically just using us for your own good if you do that.
